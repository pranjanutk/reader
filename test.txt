  The increasing size of datasets in biology has demanded a corresponding increase in the reliance on software to automate tasks that have become impossible to do manually [1]
Improvements in technology have made creating large biological datasets much easier, so that small facilities can now feasibly do large-scale genomic sequencing or proteomics
Biology in 2015 may require a researcher to be using a pipette one day and running genome assembly software the next
As the field changes to where scientists are expected to regularly use bioinformatics tools, the difficulties in sharing academic software are becoming a hindrance to both research and publication.  Bioinformatics software is seen as research output and published as journal articles
It then follows that a bioinformatics software developer is measured by the same metric as is often used for a biologist studying novel protein mechanisms - the more articles the better
This has lead to proliferation of bioinformatics software for example, the Wikipedia page for sequence aligners alone lists 64 different implementations.  Perverse incentives have lead to a -lsquofire-and-forget-rsquo approach to software publishing multiple software articles is rewarded whereas there are no direct metrics for maintaining existing software [2]
The status quo serves authors by allowing them to generate long publication lists, and serves publishers by generating revenue through article processing fees
The intended audience, the biologists trying to do research, are then left to wade through a corpus of buggy, inconsistent, and confusing tools [3]
This commentary addresses three prominent symptoms of this system: lack of software availability, difficulty installing software, and divergent formats and interfaces for common tasks.
